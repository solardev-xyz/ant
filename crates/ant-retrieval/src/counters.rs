//! Process-wide retrieval counters.
//!
//! [`RetrievalCounters`] is a tiny `AtomicU64` bag the daemon clones
//! into every [`crate::RoutingFetcher`] it builds. Each successful
//! chunk delivery (network or cache) bumps the counters once, and the
//! status publisher reads cumulative totals from them when populating
//! [`StatusSnapshot::retrieval`] for `antctl top`.
//!
//! Only the *winning* fetch is counted toward `bytes_fetched_total` —
//! losing hedge dispatches that the drain task pulls to completion
//! consume real bytes on the wire, but counting them would inflate
//! the user-facing bandwidth gauge with bytes nobody asked for. The
//! winner-only accounting keeps the gauge aligned with the work the
//! daemon actually delivered.
//!
//! Cumulative-counter design (rather than a windowed average kept in
//! the daemon) is deliberate: the consumer (`antctl top`) already polls
//! at a known cadence, so it can derive instantaneous throughput by
//! diff'ing two consecutive snapshots and apply whatever smoothing /
//! peak-tracking it wants without burning daemon CPU on a sliding
//! window we'd then have to wire through the wire format.
