//! File splitter: bytes → balanced k-ary chunk tree.
//!
//! The inverse of [`crate::joiner`]. Given a byte slice, produces every
//! content-addressed chunk needed to represent the file on Swarm: leaf
//! chunks (4 KiB of payload each) and intermediate "join" chunks (lists
//! of up to 128 child references) all the way up to a single root.
//!
//! Wire shape matches `bee/pkg/file/splitter`:
//!
//! - **Leaf chunk** = `span (8 LE) || payload (≤ 4096)`. Span equals the
//!   payload length, so a leaf is identical to whatever
//!   [`ant_crypto::cac_new`] would produce.
//! - **Intermediate chunk** = `span (8 LE) || refs`, where `refs` is the
//!   concatenation of N ∈ [2, 128] child addresses (32 bytes each) and
//!   `span` is the *total file-data bytes covered by the entire subtree*
//!   rooted at this chunk — not the chunk's own payload length.
//!
//! The tree is left-leaning: leaves are filled to 4 KiB before starting a
//! new one; intermediates at level k are filled to 128 children before a
//! new sibling is opened. This matches what bee's splitter emits and is
//! also exactly what [`crate::joiner::join`] expects on the way back.
//!
//! Returned vectors are in *push order*: data leaves first, then each
//! level of intermediates bottom-up, with the root last. Callers that
//! upload via pushsync can simply iterate; callers that need the root
//! address explicitly read [`SplitResult::root`].
