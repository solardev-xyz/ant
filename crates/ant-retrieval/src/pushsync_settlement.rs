//! Pushsync-side settlement hook.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `RoutingFetcher::push_stamped_cac` opens a `/swarm/pushsync/1.3.1/pushsync`
//! stream to the closest peer for each chunk we upload. Bee runs accounting
//! on its end of that stream: every chunk we push adds `chunk_price` PLUR to
//! the receiver's view of *our* outbound debt to *them*
//! (`pkg/accounting/accounting.go::Debit`). When that debt crosses bee's
//! `paymentThreshold` (13.5 M PLUR full-mode, 1.35 M PLUR light-mode), bee
//! either accepts a few more chunks under `paymentTolerance` or silently
//! RST's the next pushsync stream. Without us settling the debt with a
//! [`/swarm/swap/1.0.0/swap`](crate::pushsync) cheque before we cross the
//! line, every peer eventually freezes us out — exactly the behaviour
//! observed in production on 2026-05-08 when the GGUF upload stalled at
//! ~20K successful chunks across the whole peer set (≈ 200 chunks per
//! peer ≈ bee's `paymentTolerance` envelope).
//!
//! # What this trait does
//!
//! Decouples the pushsync hot path from the SWAP / cheque issuance code.
//! The fetcher knows nothing about chequebooks, EIP-712, libp2p swap
//! streams, or chain ids; it just calls
//! [`PushsyncSettlement::note_pushsync`] right after every accepted
//! pushsync receipt. The implementation in `ant-p2p::pushsync_swap`:
//!
//! 1. Tracks per-peer cumulative debt (in PLUR units) and adds `price`.
//! 2. If the new total crosses the (configurable, default ½×bee's
//!    `lightPaymentThreshold`) trigger, looks up the peer's beneficiary
//!    EOA from the [BZZ handshake info](`ant_p2p::HandshakeInfo`)
//!    cache, builds + signs an EIP-712 cheque against our chequebook for
//!    `cumulative_debit + safety_margin`, opens a swap stream and emits
//!    it via [`ant_p2p::swap::issue_and_emit`].
//! 3. On a successful emit, zeros the local debt counter (the receiver
//!    has now been paid up to the cumulative amount we recorded in the
//!    [`ant_p2p::swap::OutboundLedger`]).
//!
//! # Failure mode
//!
//! Settlement is best-effort. A failure to emit the cheque (peer
//! disconnect mid-stream, swap protocol Reset, signature mismatch) does
//! NOT fail the upload. Instead, the next `note_pushsync` for the same
//! peer re-evaluates: if the debt is still over the trigger, we try to
//! emit again with the *new* (unchanged) cumulative payout. Because
//! cheques are cumulative the retry is idempotent — bee accepts the
//! highest cumulative it has seen and ignores duplicates. If a peer
//! refuses every cheque, the fetcher's per-peer skip list will eventually
//! blacklist it, exactly as today; we just stop wasting stream opens
//! against a settled-but-still-rejecting peer.
//!
//! # Live integration
//!
//! [`RoutingFetcher::with_pushsync_settlement`](crate::RoutingFetcher::with_pushsync_settlement)
//! installs an `Arc<dyn PushsyncSettlement>`. `None` (the default) keeps
//! the legacy "push without settlement" behaviour for tests and for the
//! ultra-light read-only build.
