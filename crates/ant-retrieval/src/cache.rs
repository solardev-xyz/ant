//! In-memory LRU chunk cache shared across retrieval requests.
//!
//! The retrieval pipeline already CAC-validates every chunk on the
//! way out of [`crate::retrieve_chunk`], so cached entries are trusted
//! without re-hashing on the read path. The cache is read on every
//! [`crate::ChunkFetcher::fetch`] before we ask the network and
//! written on every successful network fetch, so:
//!
//! * Re-fetches inside a single retry attempt (e.g. a transient peer
//!   disconnect mid-walk) skip the network for chunks we've already
//!   pulled in this request — turning what was a full round-trip
//!   for the second retry into a memcpy.
//! * The whole-fetch retry wrapper in `ant-p2p` benefits transparently:
//!   attempt N+1 finds every chunk attempt N already pulled and only
//!   the dropped ones go back over the wire.
//! * A second `antctl get` of the same reference (or any reference
//!   that shares manifest / data nodes) on the same daemon process
//!   skips the network entirely.
//!
//! This is the in-memory tier described in `PLAN.md` § "chunk store".
//! A persistent tier backed by SQLite will sit underneath later;
//! the [`crate::ChunkFetcher`] integration in [`crate::RoutingFetcher`]
//! is unchanged when that lands — it just becomes a write-through
//! to the persistent layer below.
