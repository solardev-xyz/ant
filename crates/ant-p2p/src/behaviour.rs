///   `probe_missing` that *also* failed the privileged routed download,
///   i.e. no route serves it at all. This is the only safe basis for a
///   re-push (re-pushing a merely-shallow chunk from probe noise was the

/// probe misses (gateway-reachability) and the routed-confirmed misses
/// (genuinely gone). The heal re-push keys on `confirmed_missing`; the
/// user-facing "fully available" verdict keys on `probe_missing`, so a
/// shallow placement the uploader can still privilege-fetch no longer
/// reads as durably replicated.
///
/// Why two stages: the closest-peer probes are single-attempt fetches
/// with no hedging, no retry and no error backfill, so on a light node
/// they have a substantial per-chunk false-failure rate (peer churn, a
/// slow forwarding hop, an overdraft skip). Run alone they flagged ~25%
/// of a file "missing" while the public gateway streamed the very same
/// file byte-exact — and the heal then re-pushed hundreds of perfectly
/// healthy chunks on every launch. The routed confirmation pass
/// ([`verify_chunks_present`], the production fetch path: closest-first
/// through forwarder peers, hedged, with error backfill) clears those
/// false alarms, so "missing" again means "a third party can't get it".
///
/// The probe stage is kept (rather than going routed-only) because it is
/// what surfaces shallow placements: the routed pass run from the
/// uploader can be privileged — it may still be directly linked to a far
/// storer that signed a shallow receipt — but a chunk that *no* probe
/// finds and only the privileged route serves is rare now that uploads
/// dial the neighbourhood and land deep at push time; we accept that
