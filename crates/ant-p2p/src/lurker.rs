//! GSOC/PSS lurker driver — the persistent receive loop.
//!
//! Given a [`WatchState`] (watched GSOC addresses, plus registered PSS
//! topics and secret) and a target neighborhood, the lurker keeps peers
//! resident near the target, pulls the neighborhood bin live from a peer
//! (see [`crate::pullsync`]), classifies each delivered chunk
//! ([`crate::messaging::classify`]), and forwards decoded messages to a
//! subscriber channel. It runs until the subscriber drops its receiver.
//!
//! Bandwidth shape:
//!
//! - **GSOC** is precise — we watch exact SOC addresses, so the `want`
//!   bitvector requests *only* those (delivery bandwidth ≈ 0 until an
//!   update lands).
//! - **PSS** cannot be identified from the offered address (the trojan
//!   address is mined, not derivable), so when PSS is enabled the lurker
//!   must download candidate CACs and attempt unwrap — exactly what a bee
//!   full node does when it `TryUnwrap`s every passing chunk. Callers
//!   that only need GSOC leave `pss_secret` unset and pay nothing.
