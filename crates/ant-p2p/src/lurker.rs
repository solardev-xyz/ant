//! GSOC/PSS lurker driver — the persistent receive loop.
//!
//! Given a [`WatchState`] (watched GSOC addresses, plus registered PSS
//! topics and secret) and a target neighborhood, the lurker keeps peers
//! resident near the target, pulls the neighborhood bin live from a peer
//! (see [`crate::pullsync`]), classifies each delivered chunk
//! ([`crate::messaging::classify`]), and forwards decoded messages to a
//! subscriber channel. It runs until the subscriber drops its receiver.
//!
//! Bandwidth shape:
//!
//! - **GSOC** is precise — we watch exact SOC addresses, so the `want`
//!   bitvector requests *only* those (delivery bandwidth ≈ 0 until an
//!   update lands).
//! - **PSS** cannot be identified from the offered address (the trojan
//!   address is mined, not derivable), so when PSS is enabled the lurker
//!   must download candidate CACs and attempt unwrap — exactly what a bee
//!   full node does when it `TryUnwrap`s every passing chunk. Callers
//!   that only need GSOC leave `pss_secret` unset and pay nothing.

/// Correction due to Viktor Trón: which bin a trojan `c` occupies on a

/// the mined prefix length `L` — the trie geometry gives two regimes:
///
/// - **`b_p < L`**: `p` diverges from the target at bit `b_p` while `c`
///   still agrees there, so `PO(c, p) = b_p` **exactly**. One
///   deterministic bin; any window is dead weight.
/// - **`b_p >= L`**: `c` agrees with `p` through bit `L` and is mined
///   noise beyond, so `PO(c, p) = L + Geom(1/2)` — *independent of
///   `b_p`*, i.e. the trojan sits around bin `L`, **shallower** than
///   `b_p`. Pulling `b_p` and deeper (the previous behaviour) misses
///   it; the correct base is `L`, with a small deeper window for the
///   geometric tail (each +1 bin halves the missed mass).
///
/// `L` must exceed the storage depth `d` or no storer keeps the trojan
/// at all — one reason this is a network convention (sender and receiver
/// MUST agree), not a per-sender free choice.
///
/// **Why 16 and not 24.** A deeper prefix concentrates a trojan into a
/// smaller slice of the reserve (`~2^(reserve-(L-d))`), which in
/// principle cuts a *deeply-resident* receiver's candidate traffic and
/// shrinks the mailbox backlog. But that benefit needs covering peers at
/// `b_p >= L`: a light node's covering peers sit at `b_p ≈ 9-14`, so for
/// them `covering_bins` pulls bin `b_p` **regardless of `L`** (the
/// `b_p < L` regime). Measured on mainnet: at both `L=16` and `L=24` the
/// receiver pulls the same bins and downloads the same candidates — the
/// deeper prefix buys a light-node receiver nothing. It only *costs*: `L`
/// bits is `~2^L` mine hashes, so `L=24` is ~256× the sender work
/// (seconds on a phone, and it trips the send timeout), and PSS already
/// carries an economic spam gate via the postage stamp every send burns.
/// So we keep `L=16`: cheap to mine (mobile-friendly), identical receive
/// at light-node residency. (A deeper prefix as a network-wide anti-spam
