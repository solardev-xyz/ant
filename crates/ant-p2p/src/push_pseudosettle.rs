//! Cheque-less pushsync settlement: mirror push debt into the shared
//! [`Accounting`] so the pseudosettle driver refreshes upload peers.
//!
//! Perf-lab **Experiment 1** (the 512 MiB stall). Without a chequebook
//! the daemon has NO settlement on the push path at all: the only
//! [`PushsyncSettlement`] implementation was the SWAP service, and the
//! pseudosettle driver's scan covers retrieval debt (the `Accounting`
//! mirror) only. Bee meanwhile debits us for every pushed chunk in the
//! same per-peer ledger it uses for retrieval; once our unsettled debt
//! crosses its payment threshold + tolerance, it answers with
//! overdrafts and RSTs. Measured baseline signature (2026-07-05):
//! within one 256 MiB upload, throughput decayed 370 → ~145 KiB/s as
//! debt accumulated — extrapolating to the documented "uploads run for
//! ~20 K chunks then stall" failure at 512 MiB. Connection churn
//! partially masks it (bee resets per-peer accounting on reconnect),
//! which is why smaller uploads look healthy.
//!
//! Bee's own light nodes settle upload debt **time-based** via
//! `/swarm/pseudosettle` — no cheques, no chain, no BZZ. Ant already
//! runs the full pseudosettle driver for retrieval; this adapter just
//! records push debits in the same `Accounting` mirror, which
//! automatically fires the driver's `HotHint` when a peer's mirrored
//! debt crosses `HOT_DEBT_THRESHOLD`.
//!
//! DEFAULT ON since the perf-lab verdict (collapse-to-zero became a
//! stable plateau; see PERF-LAB.md exp 1). `ANT_PUSH_PSEUDOSETTLE=0`
//! disables (the A/B control arm). The SWAP service still wins when a
//! chequebook is configured (it settles harder debts and also
//! hot-hints).
