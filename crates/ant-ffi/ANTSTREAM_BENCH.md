# AntStream publisher throughput bench — issue #67, stage 1

The go/no-go gate for the AntStream publisher track: *which video
rendition can a phone broadcast directly to Swarm, on which network?*

The harness is the publisher loop minus the camera. A generator emits
HLS-shaped segments on a wall clock at a configured bitrate; each
finished segment is published with one `POST /bzz` against the
bee-shaped gateway — in-process (`ant_start_gateway`) on iOS, `antd` on
desktop. Stage 2 swaps the generator for the real capture pipeline and
adds the playlist + `POST /soc` feed writes; everything under the
generator is meant to survive that swap, which is why the measurement
lives in `crates/ant-ffi/src/bench.rs` and not in a throwaway script.

| piece | where |
|---|---|
| measurement core | `crates/ant-ffi/src/bench.rs` |
| C ABI | `ant_bench_start` / `ant_bench_progress` / `ant_bench_stop` (`crates/ant-ffi/include/ant.h`) |
| native driver | `crates/ant-ffi/examples/publish_bench.rs` |
| on-device driver | **Broadcast → Run bench** (`examples/ios-stream/AntStream/BenchView.swift`) |

## Go/no-go criteria (from #67)

1. **Sustained Mbit/s per network type** (Wi-Fi vs LTE), measured over
   **≥ 30 min** of continuous publishing, on **at least two device
   generations**.
2. A **rendition decision**: which rendition(s) phone-direct broadcast
   targets. The shortlist the bench offers is 360p (0.9), 540p (1.8),
   720p (3.4) and 1080p (6 Mbit/s).
3. **If LTE can't sustain a usable rendition**, #68 (relay fallback)
   escalates to the critical path.
4. Alongside the throughput figure: **peer-target sweep** (the desktop
   optimum is 400 peers at ~105 chunks/s ≈ 3.4 Mbit/s — find the phone
   optimum) and **battery/thermal** over the run.

A run "keeps up" when every segment published *and* the final segment
was still within three segment durations of the live edge. That single
predicate (`BenchReport::keeps_up`) backs both the `sustained` field and
the **kept up** column below — a run that quietly falls further and
further behind is not a pass, even with zero errors.

## Results

### Measured

| environment | mode | target | sustained | chunks/s | publish p50/p95/max ms | final lag ms | kept up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 8 vCPU / no network | pipeline | 3400 kbit/s | 3.40 Mbit/s | 105.5 | 80 / 102 / 109 | 108 | yes |
| Linux x86_64 8 vCPU / no network | pipeline | 20000 kbit/s | 20.00 Mbit/s | 616.0 | 342 / 453 / 474 | 329 | yes |
| Linux x86_64 8 vCPU / no network | pipeline | 60000 kbit/s | 60.00 Mbit/s | 1846.5 | 985 / 1188 / 1271 | 992 | yes |
| Linux x86_64 8 vCPU / no network | pipeline | 120000 kbit/s | 120.00 Mbit/s | 3691.9 | 1927 / 2217 / 2533 | 1959 | yes |
| Linux x86_64 / local `antd` 0.5.43, no usable batch | publish | 3400 kbit/s | 0.00 Mbit/s | 0.0 | — | — | **no** (`400 … batch … not usable`) |

Environment: Intel Haswell 8 vCPU, Linux 6.14, `ant-ffi` 0.5.43 release
build, embedded node running alongside (100–114 BZZ peers), 2 s
segments, 4-deep publish window. Pipeline rows: 180 s (3400) / 80 s
(others), 20 s warm-up excluded.

**`pipeline` is not a broadcast number.** It measures only the
on-device half of publishing — splitting each segment into its Swarm
chunk tree, BMT-hashing it and signing a postage stamp per chunk — and
stops at the socket. It is the *ceiling imposed by the CPU*, i.e. the
number that says whether the device could keep up if the network were
free.

What the measured rows do establish:

* The pre-network pipeline scales linearly with segment size
  (0.85 MB → 80 ms, 5 MB → 342 ms, 15 MB → 985 ms, 30 MB → 1.93 s):
  **≈ 124 Mbit/s per concurrent publish path** on this CPU, ≈ 36× the
  720p target. Chunking + stamping is not the bottleneck on
  desktop-class hardware, and the same run on a phone (Broadcast → Run
  bench, "Publish to Swarm" off) tells us whether it is one there.
* 3.4 Mbit/s **is** 105 chunks/s, so the desktop `--target-peers`
  sweep in PLAN.md (Phase 7g: 105.3 chunks/s at 400 peers) and this
  issue's 3.4 Mbit/s target are the same number in different units —
  a desktop node with 400 peers sits exactly at 720p.
* The publish path is wired correctly end-to-end against a real
  `ant-gateway`: the last row is a real `POST /bzz` reaching the real
  batch check, failing only for want of a funded batch.

### Owed

| environment | what's needed |
|---|---|
| iPhone (gen A) / Wi-Fi, 30 min | a device + a funded storage plan |
| iPhone (gen A) / Cellular, 30 min | ditto, on cellular |
| iPhone (gen B) / Wi-Fi + Cellular, 30 min | a second device generation |
| desktop `antd` / wired, peer-target sweep 100–400 | a funded batch |
| battery + thermal over ≥ 30 min | device only — `UIDevice.batteryLevel` is −1 on the simulator, and the app records "battery unavailable (simulator)" rather than a fictional 0 % |

**Why the network rows are not filled in from CI.** Every `POST /bzz`
needs a postage batch that is funded and unexpired on Gnosis; peers
reject stamps from anything else. The dev box this was built on has no
usable batch — both batches persisted in `~/.antd/postage` read back
from the PostageStamp contract as `depth 0, owner 0x0` (expired) — and
buying one spends real xBZZ, which is not something a CI job or an
automated agent should do unasked. Nothing else is missing: with a
batch id, the commands below produce every owed row.

## Running it

### Linux / CI — pre-network pipeline ceiling (no batch, no network)

```bash
ANT_BENCH_LABEL="Linux x86_64 8 vCPU / no network" \
ANT_BENCH_BITRATE_KBPS=3400 ANT_BENCH_DURATION_S=180 ANT_BENCH_WARMUP_S=20 \
  cargo run --release -p ant-ffi --example publish_bench
```

It prints the Markdown row (paste-ready for the table above) and the
full JSON report. Exit code is 0 only when the run kept up, so it can
gate a CI job directly.

### Desktop — real publish, with the peer-target sweep

The desktop node already has the peer-target knob (`antd
--target-peers N`, PLAN.md Phase 7f/7g), so sweeping it needs no code:
restart `antd` at each value and re-run the bench against it.

```bash
for peers in 100 200 300 400; do
  # restart antd with --target-peers $peers, wait for the peer set to fill, then:
  ANT_BENCH_LABEL="antd wired / target-peers $peers" \
  ANT_BENCH_GATEWAY=http://127.0.0.1:1633 ANT_BENCH_BATCH=0x<batch> \
  ANT_BENCH_DURATION_S=1800 \
    cargo run --release -p ant-ffi --example publish_bench
done
```

Add `ANT_FFI_DATA_DIR=<dir with a funded identity.json>` and drop
`ANT_BENCH_GATEWAY` to publish through an *embedded* node instead —
the shape the phone actually runs (the example then starts the node and
its gateway itself on `127.0.0.1:1733`).

### On a phone — the rows that gate the decision

The simulator cannot answer any of this: no cellular radio, no battery,
no thermal pressure. Run it on hardware:

1. Build and install `examples/ios-stream` on the device (a real
   signed build — never `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`, which strips
   entitlements and breaks the Keychain at runtime).
2. Get the Broadcast checklist fully green: connected, key secured,
   storage plan active, settlement ready, publishing endpoint up.
   Publishing needs all five — the bench gates on the same
   `isReadyToBroadcast` expression the checklist renders.
3. **Broadcast → Run bench.** Pick the rendition and *30 min
   (quotable)*, leave "Publish to Swarm" on, and start. Keep the app
   foregrounded — it holds the idle timer off for the run's duration,
   but iOS still suspends a backgrounded app.
4. When it finishes, **Copy results table** puts the Markdown row plus
   the run's context (segments, peers, iOS version, battery delta,
   thermal peak) on the clipboard. Paste it under **Measured** here and
   in issue #67.
5. Repeat on cellular (turn Wi-Fi off — the row's network label is
   taken from `NWPathMonitor`, not typed in, so it can't be mislabelled)
   and on a second device generation.

To sweep the peer target on a phone as well, `NodeConfig::target_peers`
has to reach the FFI first: `init_inner` currently always takes
`ant_p2p::DEFAULT_TARGET_PEERS` (100), and there is no
`ant_init_with_options` field for it. That is a small, well-scoped
follow-up — but note that at 100 peers the phone starts a factor below
the desktop's 400-peer optimum, so the first device numbers should be
read as a *floor*, not the phone's ceiling.

## Reading a report

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `sustained_mbit_s` | published bytes ÷ measured window. **The go/no-go number.** |
| `sustained_chunks_s` | the same rate in chunks, comparable to PLAN.md's `--target-peers` sweep |
| `publish_ms_p50/p95/max` | how long one `POST /bzz` took |
| `lag_ms_p50/p95/max/final` | how far behind live each segment landed (capture → published). Flat = keeping up; climbing = the uplink can't take the bitrate |
| `segments_failed` + `errors` | first few verbatim gateway errors — an unusable batch or a settlement stall shows up here, not as a slow number |
| `peers_min/max` | BZZ peer set during the run; a run that started cold is visible here |
| `sustained` | `segments_failed == 0 && lag_ms_final ≤ 3 × segment_ms` |

`warmup_s` (default 30 s) is excluded from the sustained figures: the
first segments pay peer-set warm-up and pushsync skip-cache misses.

## Scope

Stage 1 only. Not here, by design (they are stage 2 / 3 of #67):
playlist rebuilds, `POST /soc` feed updates, drop-oldest live-edge
discipline, the on-screen publish-lag indicator, foreground keep-alive
beyond the bench's own idle-timer hold, and the VOD finalize path.
