//! `AntStream` live publisher loop — issue #67 stage 2.
//!
//! Stage 1 ([`crate::bench`]) established that the publisher loop is the
//! camera pipeline plus one `POST /bzz` per segment, and measured what
//! that path sustains. Stage 2 keeps the loop and replaces the synthetic
//! generator with the real capture pipeline (#65): the iOS side hands
//! finished fMP4 segments to [`LiveRun::push`], and everything below
//! that point is the code stage 1 measured — same bounded in-flight
//! window, same loopback HTTP client, same lag accounting — now carrying
//! real video.
//!
//! What stage 2 adds on top of the measured path, per segment:
//!
//! 1. `POST /bzz` the segment (and, when the writer restarts, its fMP4
//!    initialization segment).
//! 2. Rebuild the HLS media playlist over a sliding window of the most
//!    recent segments.
//! 3. `POST /bzz` the playlist, then publish its reference as a
//!    **sequence-feed update** with `POST /soc/{owner}/{id}` — the
//!    bee-js shape (`id = keccak256(topic ‖ index_be8)`, payload
//!    `timestamp_be8 ‖ reference`), so any bee gateway resolves the
//!    channel with `GET /feeds/{owner}/{topic}` or through the feed
//!    manifest this module creates at start with `POST /feeds`.
//!
//! Live-edge discipline, straight from the stage-1 findings:
//!
//! * The in-flight window defaults to **4**. Stage 1 measured window 4
//!   as the stable point (899/899 segments at 900 kbit/s) and window 8
//!   as a *collapse* (26/316) — per-peer stream pressure destroys
//!   connections — so this is a tuned constant, not an arbitrary one.
//! * The default rendition is 360p at ~900 kbit/s with 2 s segments,
//!   the row the stage-1 go/no-go landed on.
//! * When the uplink cannot keep up, the backlog **drops its oldest
//!   pending segment** rather than growing without bound: a live
//!   broadcast that falls minutes behind is worse than one with a gap.
//!   Dropped and failed segments leave a hole, and the next segment that
//!   does land is tagged `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY`.
//!
//! Uploads go straight to the in-process gateway (`ant_start_gateway`)
//! rather than through `UploadManager` jobs on purpose: that machinery is
//! resume-oriented VOD tooling, which is the wrong shape for a live edge
//! (a resumed segment is a segment nobody will ever play). It becomes the
//! right tool in stage 3, for the VOD finalize path.
