//! D.2.3 retrieval endpoints, streaming edition.
//!
//! Wraps the existing `ant-retrieval` machinery exposed by the node loop
//! over `ant-control`'s command channel. The gateway never talks to
//! libp2p directly — every chunk fetch goes through
//! [`ant_control::ControlCommand`], reusing the routing-aware
//! [`ant_retrieval::RoutingFetcher`], its hedging, and the long-lived
//! chunk cache. Tests swap a fake "node loop" in that replies to the
//! same commands from a fixture-backed map.
//!
//! `/bytes` and `/bzz` go through the streaming dispatch path in all
//! cases:
//!
//! - **GET, no Range**: full streaming join. Headers go out as soon as
//!   the daemon emits `BytesStreamStart` / `BzzStreamStart`; body bytes
//!   stream as the joiner emits ordered subtrees.
//! - **HEAD**: streaming dispatch with `head_only = true`. The daemon
//!   resolves manifest + root span and returns metadata without joining
//!   the chunk tree.
//! - **GET, single Range**: streaming dispatch with a clamped
//!   `StreamRange`. The daemon's range-aware joiner walks only the
//!   chunks that overlap the requested byte interval; the gateway emits
//!   `206 Partial Content` with `Content-Range` and the slice length.
//!
//! Multi-range requests are still rejected with `416` — the joiner
//! produces one ordered byte stream, multipart `byteranges` would
//! demand framing logic the plan explicitly defers (PLAN.md E.20).
//! Body payloads do not materialise in memory: `Body::from_stream`
//! pumps `BytesChunk` acks into hyper as they arrive.
//!
//! `GATEWAY_MAX_FILE_BYTES` keeps the joiner's per-request size cap
//! generous enough for real bzz sites with media payloads (videos,
//! archives, large images); the CLI continues to use
//! `ant_retrieval::DEFAULT_MAX_FILE_BYTES` (32 MiB) where `antctl get`
//! is the only caller.
