/// Camera → H.264 → HLS fMP4 segments (issue #65).
///
/// `AVCaptureSession` (camera + mic) feeds an `AVAssetWriter` running in
/// `.mpeg4AppleHLS` mode, which hands back one *initialization* segment
/// (`ftyp` + `moov`) followed by a stream of *separable* media segments
/// (`moof` + `mdat`) on a wall clock — exactly the shape the publisher
/// (#67 stage 2) uploads and an `AVPlayer` plays back from a playlist.
///
/// Two things this class is careful about, because they are what a
/// 30-minute broadcast actually runs into:
///
/// * **Interruptions end a segment cleanly.** An incoming call, the app
///   backgrounding, a camera flip, an orientation change or a thermal
///   downshift all finish the current writer (so its last segment is a
///   complete, playable one) and start a fresh writer on recovery. The
///   first segment of the new writer carries a fresh initialization
///   segment and is flagged `discontinuity`, which is what lets the
///   playlist mark it `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY` instead of handing a player
///   a timeline that silently jumps.
/// * **Bitrate and segment duration are runtime-configurable.** #65 and
///   #67 were built in parallel, so the rendition is a parameter, not a
///   constant. Changing either restarts the writer (the encoder's
///   bitrate and keyframe interval are set at input creation), which is
///   the same clean-cut path an interruption takes.
///
/// Segments are also kept in a small on-disk ring buffer. They are
/// uploaded from memory, so the ring is not on the publish path; it
/// exists so a segment can be inspected, replayed locally with
/// `AVPlayer`, or (stage 3) rolled into the VOD finalize pass.
