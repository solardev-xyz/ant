/// Where AntStream's account key lives.
///
/// Both existing example apps let the Rust library create and keep the
/// account key as plaintext `identity.json` inside the app container
/// (`crates/ant-ffi` → `load_or_create_identity`). That file is readable
/// by anything that can reach the container and rides along in device
/// backups. AntStream instead owns the key itself and hands it to the
/// library at startup through `ant_init_with_identity`, so the library
/// never writes key material to disk — the `KeyProvider` backend
/// PLAN.md § 5.10 plans for iOS.
///
/// ### What "Secure Enclave" can and cannot do here
///
/// The Secure Enclave only holds **P-256** keys; Swarm/Ethereum accounts
/// are **secp256k1**, so the account key itself can never be an enclave
/// key. What the enclave *can* do is hold a P-256 wrapping key that never
/// leaves the chip, and we encrypt the identity document to it (ECIES).
/// The Keychain then stores ciphertext that is useless on any other
/// device, even if the Keychain item is exfiltrated. That is the strongest
/// protection iOS offers for a secp256k1 secret, and it is what
/// ``Protection/secureEnclave`` means below.
///
/// Enclave keys are by definition device-bound, so enclave wrapping and
/// iCloud Keychain sync are mutually exclusive. The user picks:
///
/// * ``Protection/secureEnclave`` (default) — strongest at rest, but a
///   reinstall-on-a-new-device needs the exported account key to restore.
/// * ``Protection/iCloudKeychain`` — the item syncs, so a reinstall or a
///   new device silently recovers the same account.
/// * ``Protection/deviceOnly`` — plain Keychain item, used when the
///   enclave is unavailable (older simulators return `errSecUnimplemented`
///   for enclave key creation).
///
/// Every mode uses `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock` so the node can
/// start from a `BGProcessingTask` after a reboot the user hasn't unlocked
/// past yet; the two device-bound modes add `…ThisDeviceOnly` so the item
/// is excluded from unencrypted backups.
